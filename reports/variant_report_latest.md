# Variant report 2022-07-20

## Dominant variants

BA.5 is dominating waves on all continents, together with BA.4 which is slightly less fit than BA.5 but with identical Spike so very similar.

BA.2.12.1 still makes up a good share in North America but getting replaced by BA.4/5. It's also present with smaller share around the world where BA.4/5 also replaces it.

BA.2\* that is not BA.2.12.1 made up 1-10% around the world at the end of June, with the notable exception of India where BA.2\* makes still up ~90% (and countries without much sequencing for which these statements are not possible to be made).

BA.1 only appears occasionally, in sequences that often show signs of persistent/chronic infection.

## Variants to watch out for

India has never had significant BA.1 circulation. Many fit BA.2* lineages are present there.

### BA.2.75 (S:K147E,S:W152R,S:F157L,S:I210V,S:G257S,S:G339H,S:N460K,S:G446S)

BA.2.75 seems able to compete with BA.5 in India. It was introduced or emerged later than BA.5 (first sequence end of May) and its frequency seems to range between 10-50% depending on state at beginning of July.

BA.2.75 has 9 Spike amino acid substitutions relative to BA.2 (including reversion to wild type at 493) compared to the 3 substitutions (including reversion 493) plus one 2 AA deletion (S:69/70del) for BA.4/5, making BA.2.75 the most diverged Omicron variant with significant circulation to appear since BA.1/BA.2/BA.3.

BA.2.75 does appear to circulate globally, albeit at such low share that it is not possible to say much about growth advantage outside of India.
Countries with clusters of BA.2.75 include: UK, US, New Zealand, Japan, Indonesia, Germany, Israel.
Countries that are known to have exported cases are: Nepal/India (for many Japanese airport surveillance cases), France (for some Israeli cases)

India has many states with different sampling practices so one needs to be cautious when interpreting aggregate growth advantages.

Nonetheless, the apparent growth advantage of BA.2.75 over BA.5\* at whole country aggregate level in India is compatible with a significant growth advantage. It is important to note that the statistical uncertainty does not account for systematic errors like biased sampling. The real uncertainty is much bigger than the range 81-138%.

### Selection of other interesting lineages

Many interesting BA.2 sublineages have appeared first in India. Here is a selection of some to watch. The mutations they carry are typical of BA.2 sublineages with (potential) growth advantages, in India and also globally.

## Latest developments

### South African pair of complex recombinant clusters

Two related clusters of complex Delta/BA.2 recombinants (C1 with 5 sequences and C2 with 4 sequences) have appeared in Gauteng/Limpopo (bordering region).
The Spikes are mostly identical, the rest of the genomes have multiple different breakpoints.

### German BA.2/BA.1/BA.2 recombinant with convergence to BA.2.75

A BA.2/BA.1/BA.2 recombinant with many mutations of interest has appeared in Germany with 27 sequences to date and spread across Europe.

First sequence beginning of June.

Spike shows the following changes compared to BA.2:

- Missing: T19I, 24-26del, 27S not there because that part is from BA.1* parent
- Donated: 69-70del convergent with many VOCs
- Additional S:R346K, convergent with BA.1.1
- Additional S:K147E, S:N460K and reverted S:493 convergent with BA.2.75

## Trends

There seem to be two ways in which lineages evolve:

1. Stepwise accumulation of mutations with short branches
2. "Saltation" events, where clusters attach only on long branches.

In the past, all VOCs have appeared as saltation events.
Stepwise evolution does take place and is relevant for slow sweeps.
However all fast sweeps have been caused by saltation variants.
This is maybe not surprising as any variant comes out of nowhere and long branches are a result of fast growth.
It is thus not clear which way causality goes.
Shay Fleishon and his team in Israel are analyzing the daily updated Usher tree for new long branches allowing quick detection of potentially fast growing lineages.

Many saltations seem to derive from chronic infections as opposed to fast growing lineages so the ratio of false positives is high.
